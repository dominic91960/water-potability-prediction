# Water Potability Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the potability of water based on its chemical properties. Human health depends on having access to clean, safe drinking water, and forecasting water potability may be very helpful in making sure that water quality regulations are fulfilled. This study aims to categorize water samples as potable or non-potable by analyzing several physicochemical properties using machine learning algorithms.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess a dataset containing information about the chemical properties of water samples.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the distribution of water quality parameters, identify correlations, and detect outliers or missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the dataset and engineer new features if necessary.
- **Model Selection and Training**: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the parameters of selected models to optimize performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Validate the final model using cross-validation techniques to ensure its robustness.
